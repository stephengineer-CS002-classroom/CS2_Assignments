## Description

Create a `frequency.h` header file to write a program that reads a list of integers into an array. Provide the facility to either read this array from the keyboard or a text file. You may assume that there are fewer than 100 entries in the array.

The output is to be a two-column list. The first column is the count of the number of occurrences of each element, the second column is a list of the distinct array of elements. The list should be sorted into entries in the first column, largest to smallest. 

**Do NOT sort the original array before you get the frequency table! You can sort the frequency table.**


## Functions

You need initialize pass-by-ref variables (num_used and unique_num) before you use them.


### Function frequency
You can modify original array, so do not create a new array to hold items, you can use array c[] to hold counts of items.
