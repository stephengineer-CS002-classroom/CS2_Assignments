# 04_04_abs

- Accept [04_04_abs](https://classroom.github.com/a/rpzxmVoQ)
- Get [main.cpp](main.cpp)
- Get [abs.h](abs.h)

The purpose is to understand that the compiler will call the appropriate function for the type and number of arguments supplied to the function call.


## Function

- Declare following functions in `includes/abs/abs.h`
- Implement following functions in `includes/abs/abs.cpp`


## TestB

- if you call functions `abs()`, you will get duplicate name errors or ambiguous name errors, so call them `Abs()`.
- call the four overloaded functions with four variables of type int, double, float, long.
- In each function, you should call predefined functions correctly: `abs()`, `fabs()`, `labs()`. Do not forget to `#include <cmath>`
- In each function, place a debug statement to print out which function is being called.
