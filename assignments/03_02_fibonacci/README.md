## Description

[Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number): 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

I expect you to comment on every single line. Explain it so that a non-computer programmer can fully understand it. Do not use recursion. If you do not know what recursion is, do not worry about it. I do not care about crud! Just give me a program that asks the user for a number n, then prints out the first n Fibonacci numbers.

- Acquire a positive number n.
- Use a for loop.
- Make sure you test your program with n=1, n=2, and n>2
- Pay close attention to the output formatting:
    - commas between every two numbers 
    - no comma after the last number
    - use `setw(4)` to space the numbers
    - list the numbers in one line inside a pair of square brackets.

The Fibonacci number Fi is defined as follows. $F_0$ is 1, $F_1$ is 1, and $F_i = F_{i-1} + F_{i-2}$

i = 0, 1, 2, ... In other words, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
