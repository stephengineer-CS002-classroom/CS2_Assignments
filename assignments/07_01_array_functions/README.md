## Low-Level Functions

Create a header file called `array_functions.h` and implement functions inside the header file. Functions should be able to perform the tasks any time array manipulations are needed. Pass the array, the position, the size or num_used (number of interesting elements), and items where they are needed. Avoid unnecessary arguments. The array's CAPACITY is a constant integer and is not passed into the functions (not a global variable). For now, set CAPACITY to 15. (while debugging, you may want to set the CAPACITY to 5 so you don't have to keep entering numbers.)
